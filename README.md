## How to use

For privacy, the address and phone number are placeholders. In order to
use a real address and phone number, copy `addressline1.txt.dist` to
`addressline1.txt`, `addressline2.txt.dist` to `addressline2.txt`, and
`phonelink.tex.dist` to `phonelink.tex`, then add the desired values to
those files.
